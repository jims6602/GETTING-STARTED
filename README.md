## Interview
To best prepare for the online coding challenge, here are some resources:

Fundamentals: Go back and re-educate yourself on all data structures and data structure algorithms. They come up all the time. Understand all time and space complexity. Make sure you even get into more exotic things like hashmaps, b+trees (and variants), caches (and associated algorithms). You may want to visit www.codechef.com     

Project Euler - http://projecteuler.net/. If you’ve been out of practice, do up to problem 60 or so. You should be forced to build useful libraries, which will help give practical experience for interview like problems. Don’t cheat or take shortcuts.        

Google Coding Contest has additional practice questions: http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html         

Understand high scale architecture. Go look at how other big sites are structured: http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example
